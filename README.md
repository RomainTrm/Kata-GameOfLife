# GameOfLife

Personal experimentation of the actor-model pattern with Elixir.  
I chose Conway's [GameOfLife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) kata for this.
As I am a beginner with the pattern and langage, I am fully aware this is not some kind of state-of-the-art implementation.

## How to run?

Run the app: `...> iex -S mix`  
Display the next generation: `iex> GameOfLife.Game.tick`
